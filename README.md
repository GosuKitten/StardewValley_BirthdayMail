# Birthday Mail for Stardew Valley by Kathryn Hazuka

This is my first mod and it was so fun to create it. 
I have learned a lot about modding and the kinds of problems that arise when trying to mod. 
I hope to create many fun and immersive mods!!

Sourse code is provided, with the entire Visual Studio solution included for easy use, if anyone desides to edit anything.

# Known Issues:
1. When adding the mod on the same day a villager has a birthday, the mail will not show up that day. Any other days past the initial addition of the mod will work correctly.

# Possible causes:
1. Enqueueing right after load does not work.

# Possible fixes:
1. Unknown

# Legal:
You may use this code without explicit permission as long as you credit the original creator (Kathryn Hazuka)
If you would like to add this mod to a bundle, please contact me first through skype: neborak1, and credit the original creator (Kathryn Hazuka)
